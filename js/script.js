                    Valeria – a strong and brave knight – has been tasked with stopping the undead invasion! <br>
                    She can only achieve this goal by defeating the great Zombie Leader. <br>
                    But be warned! The path to the final enemy is littered with his zombie army, and they won’t let you pass so easily. <br><br>

                    - Collect throwable daggers scattered all around <br><br>
                    - Fight the undead army by jumping on the zombies' heads <br><br>
                    - Defeat the Zombie Leader by throwing daggers at him and don’t let yourself get knocked down! <br><br>
